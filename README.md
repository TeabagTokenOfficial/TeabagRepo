Here is the github repository for Teabag Token

1. Introduction Teabag  (TBAG)  is  a  TRC10  token  on  the  Tron  ecosystem global  gold  standard  ‘pump  and  dump’  token, it  strives  to  be  the adding  value  by:  (1)  promoting liquidity  through  volatility,  and  (2)  helping  reduce  volatility  in  other  legitimate projects.  Overall,  we  see  TBAG  benefiting  all  stakeholders. The  slight  bias  in  the  logo  symbolizes  our  ambitions  to  support  the  further advan cement/  progression  of  the  overall  cryptocurrency  market.

2. Vision  and  Objectives Volatility  and  value  appreciation  are  the  founding  principles  of  Teabag  (TBAG). Volatility allows  traders  to  relieve  their  stress,  anxiety  and  frustrations  by refocusing  th eir  energy/  pump  and  dump  efforts  towards  a  single  token,  TBAG. Similar  to  a  punching  bag  for  market  participants  to  throw  hooks  and  jabs. Volatility  equals  liquidity  in  an  overall  zeroinvolving  risk,  especially  cryptocurrenc sum  game.  Like  any  investment ies,  we  encourage  and  advocate responsible  trading  of  Teabag  (TBAG)  with  caution  and  due  consideration. Value  appreciation erall  upward is  anticipated  over  time,  with  awareness  and  adoption (both  for  TBAG  and  the  wider  cryptocurrency  market),  we  endeavour  towards an  ovtrending  longvolume  weightedterm  mean price  line  on  a  trailing  60/  90+  day average  price  (VWAP). The  volatility  is  then  purely  stochastic. Initial  value  of  TBAG  is  zero.  There  is  no  intrinsic  value  other  than  a  release mechanism  for  investor s  to  pump  and  dump (like  dunking  a  teabag).  The  value is  therefore  speculative,  an  abstract  for  a  hopefully  cleaner  more  stabilised market.  Over  time  with  growing  popularity  driving  up  demand,  we  believe value  appreciation  of  TBAG  in  line  with  idiosyncr in asies  and  wider  market  forces. Unlike  many  cryptocurrencies,  TBAG  is  environmentally  friendly  as  there  is  no backing  technology,  no  development  team,  no  hopes  or  dreams  for  world domination,  and  no  drama. TBAG  provides  a  simplistic  solution  to  an otherwise  overly  complicated  and overly  heated  market,  with  demand  for  TBAG  serving  as  the  release  valve. 3 of 8 Page 

3. Why Tron Ecosystem . TRON promises  its  users  and  developers  high  scalability,  availability  and throughput.  By  improving  the  TPS  in  TRON  for  the purpose  of  using  it  as  a practical  use  case,  a  high  throughput  is  achieved.  In  turn,  DApps  can  be implemented  using  TRON  smart  contracts,  as  well  as  support  many  users. This results  in  an  improved  rewards  distribution  mechanism  due  to  its  reliable network structure,  value,  user  asset  and  decentralised  consensus. But,  with  many  cryptocurrencies  competing  with  advantages  offered  by  TRON, the  TRON  TRX  cryptocurrency  has  its  exclusivities: 

- Convenient  cost-effective  solution  to  using  dApp  functions  on  blockchain 
- Developer  rights  include  deploying  dApps  in  the  Tron  net,  expanding business  and  acquiring  awareness  as  influencers 
- Network  witnesses  show  support  for  Tron  and  its  profits 
- Cutting-edge  blockchain  technology The  Tron  wallet  supports  TRX,  as  well  as  other tokens on the main net.

We believe  Teabag  (TBAG)  is  well  placed  as  a  valuable  component  of  the  wider cryptocurrency  market,  as  well  as  capitalise  on  the continued expansion and growth  journey  of  Tron  as  a  marketleading  blockchain.

4. Technical Token Standards Teabag (TBAG) is a TRC-10 token on the Tron ecosystem. TRC-10 is a technical standard by the Tron blockchain without depending on the Tron Virtual Machine (TVM). TRC-10 tokens are seamlessly compatible with all major cryptocurrency wallets. This makes it easier for investors and traders. The majority of Tron-based tokens in the market today are TRC-10 standard, and these tokens are issued by system contract. 

5. Market Positioning / Value Proposition Our team believes that there is significant demand for an asset that is essentially a meme coin with a strong value upside. We intentionally wanted to create a token with high volatility. Although this volatility can present significant investment risk, when correctly harnessed, it can also generate solid returns for shrewd investors. Even when markets fluctuate, crash, or surge, there can be an opportunity.  By engaging in beneficence activities, token burns, and seeking like-minded partnerships intended to continue raising awareness and token value for token holders, we believe that there is a unique position for a token built with an emphasis on its volatility and value appreciation.  

6. Target Market Anyone interested in the cryptocurrency market seeking liquidity or helping draw away volatility from legitimate projects, both retail and institutional investors alike. We anticipate over time the long-term mean price line for Teabag (TBAG) would generally appreciate in line with increased awareness and user adoption, both for TBAG as well as the wider market.

9. Roadmap Exciting times are ahead in the journey of Teabag (TBAG), as it first finds its foothold in the cryptocurrency market before aspiring to wider popularity. We have developed a 2-year roadmap as a guide for the path ahead: 

1) build community support
   By involving the community in a variety of charity and participation activities, we hope to form a lasting community that enjoy being a part of the broader movement for cryptocurrency adoption. Details    for these events can be found on the team's discord and reddit.

2) list on regional exchanges for greater access/ reach to TBAG
   Getting onto exchanges is central to increasing awareness of our project. To that end, our main push in our first quarter will be consistent listings on increasingly larger exchanges

3) utilise various social media channels to help raise awareness and drive more demand
   The impact of social media on increasing awareness is a major strength for our project. By strategizing activities and events that appeal to the various subgroups within cryptocurrency, our team strongly believes in TBAG's potential to be a project that people want to be involved in due to the high volume of things to do and ongoing communication related to upcoming events.

4) have fun
   There is a significant fun factor in participating in growing projects. Continued innovation within the social media space will allow for more frequent and more diverse    events that will be integral in attracting participants from a wider range of backgrounds and talents. Having experienced this in multiple different tokens, our team feels confident that we will be able to provide an environment where    both new and seasoned cryptocurrency advocates will have a chance to be involved in a cryptocurrency    project that isn't narrowly focused on asset price.
